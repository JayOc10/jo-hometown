        High Desert of Southern California, Hesperia was built on the spirit and
        strength of character of American frontiersmen. From the time of the
        first documented travelers through the area in the late 1700s and
        continuing into the 1900s, the region has been a place of innovation and
        magnificent feats, where men have traveled through to new lands for a
        new start, striking it rich or making that big business deal in a new
        frontier.

      <p id="hotel">
        The hotel proved a hot spot on the corner of Spruce Street and Hesperia
        Road in the days before Route 66. Polish pianist and composer Ignacy Jan
        Paderewski who, in 1919, served as the first prime minister of the newly
        independent Poland stayed at the hotel in 1922 after a landslide covered
        the tracks in the Cajon pass, halting his southbound train.

        "I have lived in Sourthern California for 27 years. I love the view of
        the mountains full of snow during the winter and in the summer going to
        the lakes around the area."
